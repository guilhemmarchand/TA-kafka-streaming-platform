Welcome to the Splunk Technology addon for Kafka streaming platform documentation
=================================================================================

**The Technology addon for Kafka streaming platform is a simple addon that provides indexing and searching time configuration to monitor and index the events from Apache Kafka components, as well as Confluent stack components:**

* Zookeeper
* Apache Kafka Brokers
* Apache Kafka Connect
* Confluent schema-registry
* Confluent ksql-server
* Confluent kafka-rest

**The addon replaces advantageously the deprecated Splunk addon for Kafka, which manages only Zookeeper and brokers components.**

**The addon is as well used by the Kafka monitoring application and ITSI module to provide integration between metrics and logs:**
